# Godot Boilerplate

Currently work in progress boilerplate project for Godot 3.x

Contains some basics needed to get a project moving quickly:
* Bootstrap script for basic initialization
* Loading scene
* Global data store (soon to include save file loading and saving `TODO`)
* Updates to default input keys (WASD is added for directions)
* Audio loading `TODO`

## Usage
`TODO`
